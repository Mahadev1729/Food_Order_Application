#App optimization methods
- 1.Chunking {smaller chunks}
- 2.Code splitting
- 3.dynamic bunding

Lazy loading
-a design pattern in react that holds component and resource  only when they are needed,rather than all at once

it is fuction which conatins the callback function and import();

#Episode 10
Higher order component-{takes input as a component and return component}

   -to avoid the prop drilling

Redux start(Episode 12)
redux and react are different libries

Redux Toolkit Architecture:
# for modification the slice of redux store
  =>when you click add button it dispatch and action after that
   it called reducer function to modify the slice of the redux store

complete the theory

#Redux Toolkit:
  1- install libries{redux Toolkit}
  2- Build our store
  3-connect our store to the App
  4-create card slice
  5-selector
